				<h2>Case Study</h2>
				<p>Mrs. Jones and Mrs. Wendi are neighbors and they both want to invest their money into the bank to
					earn some
					interest. They both have 1000 dollars as their initial investments, and they learned that the
					interest rate
					is 12% for a year. Mrs. Jones chose to save with simple interest. The graph shows Mrs. Jones savings
					after three years.

						The initial principal investment for Mrs.Jones is $ <input type="number" id="initial_principal"

			<h2>Comparison of Simple Interest and Compound Interest</h2>
			<p>From the previous case, Mrs. Jones wants to keep a simple interest, and after three years, she will get 360 dollars. Mrs. Wendi wants to keep a compound interest, and after three years she will get 404.93 dollars back. </p>
			<p> i) For Mrs. Jones, she earns (  ) dollars each month.<br>

			<p>ii) Based on the graph showing how Mrs. Jones and Mrs. Wendiâ€™s savings grow, what are the interests of Mrs. Jones and Mrs. Wendi in the first year? What about the second year? The third year?</p>
